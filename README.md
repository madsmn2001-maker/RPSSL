Rock Paper Scissor Spock Lizard, is an advanced version of the populer game rock paper sciccors.
The program makes you play against an "agent" better known as the computer, and the agent will pick a random shape everytime.
It is a best of 9 so you win the game by getting 5 wins before the agent does. It has an entry menu and keeps track of scores during the rounds.
In the program there is an overview of which shapes beat which. Enjoy!
